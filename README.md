# Machine Learning
   > Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed for every task. It works by using algorithms to find patterns in data, which allows the system to improve its performance on a specific task over time as it is exposed to more data.
